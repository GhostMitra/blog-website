So bascially this is Ghost's First just to test this hugo blogging website made by himself and interact with you all.

Learnt many things like developing a hugo theme, importing archetypes and making this hostable to his domain. Also learnt about how to add utteranc and use my repo as a comment sectiuon in github. Isn't that interesting. Basically this are the first towards a DevOps Engineer....

Do give any suggestion for improvement
